# picture package for LaTeX

Version: 2024-01-12 v2.0


There are macro and environment arguments that expect numbers
that will internally be multiplicated with \unitlength.
This package extends the syntax of these arguments that
dimens with calculation support can be added for these arguments.

Most of the functionality is already by provided
by a current LaTeX and so by default the package is disabled and does
nothing. Support for the syntax of the calc package can be forced by 
loading the package with the option `calc`.
